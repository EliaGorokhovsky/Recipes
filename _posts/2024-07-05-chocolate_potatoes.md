A chewy dessert made with cocoa and cookie crumble. Has nothing to do with potatoes. There is a non-chocolate variant available.

Boil 500 mL milk in a medium saucepan over low heat.

In the meantime, crack the eggs into a large mixing bowl and whisk lightly. Add the sugar and whisk it in. Add the flour and begin to whisk it in. When the mixture is fairly dense and whisking becomes difficult, switch to a spoon. 

Add the cocoa and mix well. The mixture should be very viscous. 

Add the remaining milk to the mixing bowl and mix until homogeneous. The mixture should be fairly smooth, syrupy, and viscous. If needed, add more flour and mix. The right consistency depends on the number of biscuits used: more biscuits requires more liquidity.

Increase heat on the milk to medium-high or high. When the milk starts steaming, lower the heat to medium and mix in the chocolate syrup with a wooden spoon. Mix while pouring so it doesn't burn at the bottom. Make sure to mix well and keep the chocolate syrup off the bottom. After mixing for a while, the mixture should be chunky. At this point, reduce heat to low.

Mix until the mixture is homogeneous, making sure to scrape bits off the bottom frequently. 

Wait for the mixture to boil and bubble a bit; you can help this process out by moving the mixture around so it gets thinner in some regions. When it's almost ready, it will make a hissing or crackling sound: this is the bubbles trying to form. Once it begins to bubble, turn off the heat and wait for the mixture to cool.

Add the butter and wine. Add the crushed biscuits and mix with your hands until it reaches the consistency of Play-Doh.

Roll the mixture into small balls about 1in in diameter, then coat each ball in cocoa.

Refrigerate for at least a few hours, preferably overnight.
